NOTE: Please keep in mind this is me experimenting what has already been done!
      If the parser itself seems heavily changed, then please don't worry. It's just me
      trying things out to fix errors, and unable to change them back in this file.
      I keep copies of all of the repository files, and only pushed this one so I 
      don't mess up what we already have. I plan on converting everything in this file to
      be as close as possible to the original, once I debug further.

Changes Made: 
- Added a global array of tokens instead of a global pointer.
          - when I took a look at the original parser.c file I noticed that a pointer was 
            declared without any reference to a structure that will actually hold the tokens
          - pointers are only temporary, and cannot point to more than one thing at a time.
          - turned tok into a non-pointer token_type for testing purposes

- Added the token (the sym type only because I haven't figured out how to properly add the aToken_type
  kind of tokens yet) in the main function.
	- these tokens are added into the proper array index. 
	- when taking a look at do_lex I noticed that it wasn't storing tokens either, but rather
          holding them, displaying them, and releasing them (freeToken) as they came.

- Put function prototype typing as token_type
        - testing purposes only
        - Because tok in this file is not global, it needs to be passed in and returned at 
          each iteration. This is because changes made in functions don't exist outside of 
          the function unless they are global, or unless they are passed back (actually might
          be possible to make tok global now that I think about it). I was personally taught
          that global pointers aren't really a good idea, but that's just me. 

- Changed a few things in Parser (Testing purposes only!)
        - I have checked, and the tokens are now passing into the parser correctly (the 
          commented out printf statement in advance() will show them as they go. 
        - Noticed errors in the error output of the parser once this was done, and am 
          currently experimenting to see what the actual problem is
        - I will not touch the parser in parser.c unless I figure it out, and plan to change
          as little of it as possible.

- Did not use tokens.c when testing, as it worked fine without it.

If there are any questions please let me know!
