C has no native boolean type, but I labeled some of the below as bool just to indicate I didn't think they would have a return value other than some success/failure indicator. I tried to list them in logical order of execution, 

void  SetFlags (int argc, char* argv[]);
bool  DisplayTextFile (File* infile);
bool  RemoveComments (File* infile, File* outfile);


LOOP:

  I'm not sure if these next two functions should be seperate functions or a single one.

  char[] GetNextLexeme (File *);
  bool   MakeToken(char[]);   <--- should this call a function to report error messages (the 4 lexical errors we should catch)
                                 or have an int return value indicating when one of those errors occured? Guess it depends on the control 
                                 structure we end up going with.

  void  DisplayLexicalError(int errorCode);   <only run if an error encountered>
  bool  InsertToken (HashTable* h, Token t);
  bool  LookupToken (HashTable* h, Token t);
  
:END-LOOP

bool  DisplayAllTokens (HashTable* h);
