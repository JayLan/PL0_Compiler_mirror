Changes made to parser.c: 
- moved some of the code from lexer.c 's main function into the main function of the parser. 
- main now does the following: 
	- creates file pointers
	- checks the validity of file pointers
	- calls lexer.c to remove comments from source file
	- retrieves, displays, and frees the token using lexer.h and lexer.c
NOTE: Tested locally on CodeBlocks, therefore does not take in arguments from command line. This can be easily fixed.

Changes made to lexer.c: 
- removed data structures because they are stored in tokens.h
- commented out the main function because most of it was moved to parser.c
- made changes to displayToken so that the output is that specified by the assignment details
- commented out setOptions because I tested without taking parameters from the command line
NOTE: setOptions must be modified to accommodate for the different flags that must be used for this assignment as specified
      in the assignment details. 

Changes to tokens.h: 
- included ifndef, define, and endif to avoid declaration errors
NOTE: The aToken_type array can probably be pulled into main, because that is where the tokens are originally sent to. 

Changes to lexer.h: 
- added only the function prototypes for the one that parser.c needs to actively call
	- displaySourceFile
	- removeComments
	- displayToken
	- freeToken
	- getNextToken
